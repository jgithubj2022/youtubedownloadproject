In my HTML implementation for my youtube download converter I focused on creating a visually engaging and easy to navigate interface. The layout is dark themed with a center container aligned with the fonts header. The container in the centere allows the input the link in a clear and direct manner.

For the CSS I used a dark color scheme with contrasting text colors to enhance readability and maintain a clean aesthetic. The animated header uses keyframes to rotate colors, adding dynamic flair to the page.the Js is designed with responsiveness and interactivity in mind as when you hvoer with your mouse, there are effects that provide user feedback. The effects in the js allow the convert button to enhance in size when hovered over.
